      <p>I have been several times in Wynwood and every time I discover a new gallery, restaurant or another amazing graffiti art work! Yes, Wynwood, together with the Design District is one of the most well-known art district of a city, whose cultural art scene is booming.
Wynwood is a very young neighborhood, and only two decades ago was a really different place. It was originally a Puerto Rican, called El Barrio or San Juan working class neighbourhood, mostly known for its big warehouses and factories. The first step towards its transformation was in 1987: a group of artists purchased the former Flowers Baking Company building transforming it in Florida’s largest working artists’ space, Bakehouse Art Complex, which it’s still working today. Since then, artists began to move to Wynwood, thanks to its big empty spaces and its affordable rents, and in 2000’s the neighborhood experienced a great attention in terms of real estate investments. Studio artists, galleries, lounges, restaurants, clubs began to open transforming Wynwood in the most vibrant neighborhood in Great Miami!

<h3> Wynwood Walls </h3>
<div class="p">
<p> The Wynwood Walls started in 2009, by one of the key man of Wynwood’s success: Tony Goldman, a developer who wanted to transform the neighborhood in the biggest open-air graffiti art museum in the world. Comprised of six separate warehouses, the walls are giant canvases for the greatest graffiti artists, more than 90 since the project was born. </p>
