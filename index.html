  <h3> About Me </h3>
  <div class="p">
  <p>Welcome to Discovering Miami! I’m Martina, an Italian international exchange student at University of Miami! I arrived in Miami in January 2018 and since my time here is nearly up, I’ve decided to create this blog to show all the incredible places and experiences offered by the Magic City! If you want to discover a little bit more about Miami, enjoy me!

  <h3> Why Miami? </h3>
  <div class="p">
    <p> Miami is not only about palms and beaches, it’s a land where Anglo America, Latin America and the Caribbean culture are mixed together creating an unique mix of colours, tastes, music and feelings!
As I said Miami is so many things, but to most visitors is mainly sun, glamour and nightlife. Discovering Miami is here to unveil you the power of a city which includes so many different neighbourhoods: from the graffiti – covered walls of Wynwood to the Latin vibes of Little Havana, form the pastel colours of the Art deco district in South Beach to a road trip across the Florida Keys!
