      <div class="p">
      <p>If you are looking for some Latin vibes, Little Havana is your neighbourhood! <br>Its heart is the vibrant Calle Ocho (SW 8th St), with its Walk of Fame: like the original one in Hollywood Bouleavard, it has a series of stars embedded in the cement, an homage to some of the most famous Latino figures in modern history, like Gloria Estefan or Celia Cruz. Walking through Calle Ocho you will have the chance to feel some authentic Latin vibes and tastes which will make you feel like you were in Cuba. <br>One of the most peculiar thing you will notice in Calle Ocho is the presence of Los Gallos de Calle Ocho, six-foot multi-coloured rooster statues which stand along the street. According to the Cuban tradition, rooster is a symbol of strength and humility and a lot of chickens are commonly seen wandering around Little Havana!
<br> Besides Roosters, cafè con leche, empanadas and mojitos, two are the most recognizable icons of Little Havana: the first is Domino Park which is a truly landmark in Calle Ocho, a place where locals have been playing domino for decades. Rain or shine Cuban elderly people meet everyday to compete and stay mentally sharp. The second is represented by the cigar factories of Little Havana where you can smell the authentic essence of Cuba. One of my favourite is Guantanamera Cafè, where you can see how a  tabacalera (roller) wrap a cigar or simply sipping a Cuban coffee or a mojito. <br>Another great place I recommend is Los Pinarenos Fruteria, a fruit and flowers stand which offers a variety of fresh fruit juices: the most famous one is guarapo, sugar cane juice, considered to be the best in Little Havana.
